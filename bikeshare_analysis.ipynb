    "Yulu has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared electric bicycles depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric bicycles in the Indian market.\n",

    "- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric bicycles in the Indian market?\n",
    "- How well do those variables describe the electric bicycle demand.\n",

    "    - 4: heavy rain + ice pallets + thunderstorm + mist, snow + fog\n",
    "- temp - air temperature in degrees Celsius\n",
    "- atemp - feeling temperature in degrees Celsius\n",
